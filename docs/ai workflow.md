# AI Query

* I will post one spec and one or more files. Understand and acknowledge only, don't suggest anything.
* * post spec
* * post file
* `Now that I have posted the code, let's start. Here is what I need help with:`


# Required Code Structure

* The name of the file needs to be on the first line of the file as a comment like `# filename.py`
so it can be easily copyed and pasted into a query.
* Alternatively, we could use a module docstring with the filename in it. This would also be compatible with a hashbang.
* Each file must be less than 10000 characters (about 300 lines) because queries are limited.
* As the AI can figure out the logic of the code, line comments are not needed, and may even be distracting and counterproductive. Comments also take up valuable characters in the query, so they should be avoided.
